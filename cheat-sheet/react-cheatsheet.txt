what is react js ?
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 
It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies


what are components in react js ?
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components



what is state in react js ?
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. 
A component's state can change over time. whenever it changes the component re-renders.


what is props in react js ?
Props are arguments passed into React components. it is passed in components 
props stands for properties.




what are Hooks in react js ?
They let you use state and other React features without writing a class


types of hooks:

1) useState : The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. State generally refers to data or properites that need to be tracking in an application.
              useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
              1) The current state.
              2) A function that updates the state.
              example : const [state, setState] = useState(0)


2) useEffect : The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data
               useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional. useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
               
               Some effects require cleanup to reduce memory leaks. Timeouts, subscriptions, event listeners, and other effects that are no longer needed should be disposed.
               We do this by including a return function at the end of the useEffect Hook.
               example : useEffect(() => {},[]) or useEffect(() => {},[value])

               
3) useRef : The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders. It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
            It can be used to access a DOM element directly. useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current. 
            When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0). In general, we want to let React handle all DOM manipulation. 
            But there are some instances where useRef can be used without causing issues. In React, we can add a ref attribute to an element to access it directly in the DOM.
            


4) useReducer : The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook. It allows for custom state logic. 
                If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.
                The reducer function contains your custom state logic and the initialStatecan be a simple value but generally will contain an object.
                The useReducer Hook returns the current stateand a dispatchmethod.


Context api and useContext hook : React Context is a way to manage state globally. we create a context with createcontext() 
                                  we get provider and consumer . wrap component with provider in which we need to pass value and cover component with consumer to which we need the value to
                                  consumer side code can be hard to read if more than one consume is there . useContext hook to the rescue . it simply the code on consumer side


React-Router : Create React App doesn't include page routing. React Router is the most popular solution
               We wrap our content first with <BrowserRouter>. Then we define our <Routes>. An application can have multiple <Routes>. 
               <Route> can be nested. The first <Route> has a path of / and renders component. The nested <Route> inherit and add to the parent route
               The component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. That specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, which is /.
               Setting the path to * will act as a catch-all for any undefined URLs. This is great for a 404 error page.
