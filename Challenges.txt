Challenges that I faced during bootcamp where to learn front end technologies . 
front end technologies were never my cup of tea . i am interested in backend technologies .
while learning react I tried to understand it deeply and try to push myself . 
implemented hooks separately to understand it nicely . for example for useState build a counter app .
other Challenges I faced was css . I improved it by practicing it more and tried to understand it deeply.
some things that i was not used to but grew into it was formatting code and structure code properly
